Prototype ideas for website:
- Computer Science library (Sells books, products, etc.)
- Code editor
- Graph visualizer / creator (can save graphs and visualize specific algorithms)
- Alan Turing website (view history, make turing machines, etc.)
- Site that let's you compare high-level code to assembly language (could also be a feature for 'code editor')
- A site similar to LeetCode
